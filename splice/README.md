This directory contains code to (1) help simulate galaxies in isolation and (2) splice the results together to form protocluster initial conditions.

Key scripts:
* *start_gizmo_isolated_galaxy.py* operates on a Makegalaxy HDF5 output file to start simulating the galaxy in isolation. It estimates the resources required, creates a new simulation directory, and starts Gizmo with the Slurm scheduler.
* *choose-snaps.py* chooses HDF5 snapshot files from isolated simulation output that we will use for the final initial conditions for each galaxy.
* *generate_protocluster.py* splices together HDF5 files for different galaxies to form initial conditions for the protocluster. It can assign random positions and velocities for the different galaxies or load already-chosen positions and velocities with the `--load` argument.

Run `$ python script_name.py --help` to see usage.

Other interesting files:

**chosen-1e6/\*.hdf5, chosen-1e7/\*.hdf5** (except for realizations, below)

These are the final initial conditions for each galaxy in 1e6 and 1e7 resolution respectively. They were chosen from the results of simulation in isolation.

**chosen-1e6/real\*.hdf5, chosen-1e7/real\*.hdf5**

These HDF5 files give protocluster initial conditions for certain sets of initial positions and velocities for the galaxies. `chosen-1e6/realXXX.hdf5` and `chosen-1e7/realXXX.hdf5` are the same realization (set of positions and velocities) but with different resolutions. 

**chosen-1e6/real\*-log/, chosen-1e6/real\*-log/**

These directories contain supporting "log" material for the protocluster initial conditions. Each has a table of galaxy masses, PDFs with plots, as well as Gizmo parameter files (.param) and Slurm batch scripts (.slurm_job.sh) with some fields filled in (e.g. masses). These folders also contain pickle files with the actual positions and velocities assigned to the galaxies, as well as .hdf5 symlinksâ€”together they can be used by generate_protocluster.py to reconstruct the initial conditions with the `--load` option.
