Makegalaxy was giving errors for the file South5.txt here.
I found that I could avoid errors by perturbing the halo mass
by a very small amount; this resulted in South5-roundedhalo.txt.
The perterbation is miniscule so we can use makegalaxy's result
for South5-roundedhalo.txt as the South5 initial conditions.
